    <p>Mechatronics engineering blends electronics, mechanical systems, and computer programming to design and build intelligent machines and systems. It involves creating devices that can autonomously sense, process information, and act upon their environment. Engineers in mechatronics develop robots for manufacturing, automated vehicles for transportation, and smart devices for various applications. It's a field where technology meets innovation, aiming to enhance efficiency and functionality across industries.
        <br>Personally I will be trying to build projects around the following 3 subdisciplines of Mechatronics:<ol><li>Control Systems and Automatiom</li>
            <li>Embedded Systems and Digital Logic Systems</li>
            <li>Artificial Intellegence and Machine Learning</li>
        </ol>
