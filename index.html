            <p>Enough poking with the 3D model. But if you've touched that thing let's first know what it is:
                <br>FlashBack üì∑ ‚ú® üòµ
                <br>Back in 1978, Sweden gave us the ABC 80, a computer so advanced it made typewriters tremble in fear. Sporting a Zilog Z80 processor, this beast had a whopping 16 KB of RAM‚Äîenough to store maybe two of your selfies today. Its monochrome display could show a staggering 78x72 characters, perfect for reading pixelated novels. With its robust build, this machine could survive a Viking raid. Why am I suddenly feeling like a salesman from the 80's. Let's get back to the present.
                <br>Present üéÅ
                <br>From the humble Z80 processor, we've leaped to today's processors that outperform its modest capabilities. Now, we're talking about multi-core processors, GPUs that rival the supercomputers of past decades, and software that harnesses the power of cloud computing with just a click. Robotics isn't just about moving parts anymore; it's about AI-driven machines that learn, adapt, and collaborate with humans in ways we once only dreamed of.
                <br>Technology has come a long way, and I'm thrilled to be part of this journey forward. So, buckle up! As you are going to see some of the projects that I have worked on (they're basic projects but you will probably like them). Continue with the big talk .....
                <br>Because if we're going to build the future, we might as well enjoy the ride ‚Äî one algorithm at a time.
